                  Through her undergraduate degree at Olin College of Engineering, two years of acting school in Dublin, Ireland, and the school of Figuring-It-the-Heck-Out during COVID, Cecelia used writing to grapple with family, home, and personal fulfillment. Predictably, her newest manuscript, THE LAND OF HEART AND HOME, contains all of these themes, along with a good dose of corsetry, Irish Nationalism, gut-warming pub stews, broken hearts, and hoity-toity balls. The manuscript was also recently selected for 2023 Smooch Pit Mentorship Program.              </p>

                  Cecelia canâ€™t wait to continue to grow as a writer and person through whatever opportunities she finds next. She anticipates this book will be the first of many she writes, because the dam has been broken and the words, they floweth.
